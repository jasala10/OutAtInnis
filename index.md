Out at Innis (O@I) is a 2SLGBTQ+ advisory and advocacy group formed in 2024 by staff and students at Innis College. Seeking to make our college an even more welcoming and inclusive place, we conduct advocacy initiatives, host events, among many other things. 

We are active on Instagram. [Follow us!](https://www.instagram.com/outatinnis)

This website seeks to make accessible (and extensible) our large collection of 2SLGBTQ+ resources relevant to University of Toronto students. 

If there is a resource you know of that you think would be useful on this website, please drop us a line! (out.innis@utoronto.ca)
