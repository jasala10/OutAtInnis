>(Of course, this page and folder wouldn't be part of the final website)

**How would this website be maintained next year?**

- It's very straightforward:
	- Next owner will:
		- download Obsidian (notetaking app) 
		- download our current vault (set of folders/files associated with the website)
		- take around 20 minutes on a Zoom call with Jake to:
			- sign up for GitHub, and connect their Github account to the O@I website
			- learn how to edit the website (all through Obsidian notetaking app)
			- learn how to publish changes (at the click of a button!)
			- troubleshoot any issues

**How much would this cost?**

- What I have right now is free!
- However, at $50 USD / year we would get:
	- The ability to have our website under a custom domain (which we would have to pay for separately as well, unless Innis/UofT can give us `outatinnis.utoronto.ca` or something similar)
	- Make a custom favicon
	- Other less relevant (I think) stuff. More info [here](https://flowershow.app/pricing) 

**I don't like how it looks!**

- We can change it! Lots of different templates available.
